🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/tanmaydixit27/Form-backend
cd Form-backend
2️⃣ Install Dependencies

npm install
3️⃣ Create a .env File
Inside the server/ directory, create a .env file and add the following:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/form-builder
Replace <username> and <password> with your MongoDB credentials.

4️⃣ Start the Server

node server.js
The backend will run on http://localhost:5000(I have deployed my frontend and backend by that I have made suitable changes in the code so for running the application remove my deployed links from the code and add PORT 5000)
